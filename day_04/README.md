# Banker Roulet

The program in question is designed to randomly select a name from a pre-defined list of names. The selection process is entirely random, and each person on the list has an equal chance of being chosen.

The consequence of being selected is that the person whose name is picked will be responsible for paying for everyone's food bill. This means that if a group of people is eating out at a restaurant or ordering takeout, the person whose name is selected will be required to foot the entire bill, including tax and tip.

## Instructions

Run the program and enter the names of the people participating in the input box, separating the names with a comma and space.

## Example Input

> Angela, Ben, Jenny, Michael, Chloe

Note: notice that there is a space between the comma and the next name.

## Example Output

> Michael is going to buy the meal today!
